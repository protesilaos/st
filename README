My soft fork of st - simple terminal
====================================

This is a soft fork of `st`. It implements a limited selection of official patches and makes some marginal modifications to the program's base configurations.

IMPORTANT. This repo is intended primarily for personal use. It shall serve as a base for a bespoke `makepkg` port on Arch Linux.

st - simple terminal
--------------------
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.


Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.
